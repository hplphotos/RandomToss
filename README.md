# RandomToss
Contains Python files for the Random Toss classes for a simulation.

The program simulates the tossing of random tossing of objects with different numbers of sides, such as coins, dice, dradels,a deck of cards, and roulette wheels.  

The concept is to use object oriented programming to start with a generic "Polyhedron" class and then to derive other classes with specific numbers of sides from the base class.
